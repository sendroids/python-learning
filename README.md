# Python Learning Repository

This repository documents my personal learning journey with Python programming. Each script represents my exploration of specific Python concepts and use cases, from basic syntax to advanced features. Over time, this collection has become a comprehensive set of hands-on learning materials that cover most common Python use cases. The scripts are organized into three difficulty levels: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced.

## Purpose

This repository started as my personal learning diary, where I created practical examples to understand how Python works in real-world scenarios. As I progressed through different topics, these scripts evolved into a collection of hands-on learning materials that demonstrate most common Python use cases.

## Scripts Overview

### Basics

These scripts document my exploration of fundamental Python concepts.

#### [Hello World](scripts/Basics/hello_world.py)
A simple introduction to Python that prints "Hello World" to the console. This is the traditional first program for any programming language.

#### [Math Operators](scripts/Basics/math_operators.py)
My exploration of basic mathematical operations in Python, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more advanced operations.

#### [String Operators](scripts/Basics/string_operators.py)
My exploration of working with strings in Python, including string concatenation, formatting, slicing, and common string methods.

#### [Conditionals](scripts/Basics/conditionals.py)
My exploration of using if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in code based on different conditions.

#### [Lists and Loops](scripts/Basics/lists_and_loops.py)
My exploration of creating and manipulating lists, and different types of loops (for loops, while loops) to iterate through data.

#### [Dictionary](scripts/Basics/dictionary.py)
My exploration of dictionaries, which are key-value data structures in Python. Demonstrates creating, accessing, and modifying dictionary entries.

#### [Functions](scripts/Basics/functions.py)
My exploration of defining and calling functions, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

#### [Simple Class](scripts/Basics/simple_class.py)
My introduction to object-oriented programming, exploring how to create and use simple classes in Python.

#### [Exceptions](scripts/Basics/exceptions.py)
My exploration of handling errors in Python using try, except, and finally blocks to make code more robust.

#### [Working with Files](scripts/Basics/working_with_files.py)
My exploration of reading from and writing to files, which is essential for working with data stored on disk.

### Intermediate

These scripts document my exploration of more advanced topics that build upon the basics.

#### [Args and Kwargs](scripts/Intermediate/args_kwargs.py)
My exploration of using `*args` and `**kwargs` to create flexible functions that can accept variable numbers of arguments.

#### [Comprehensions](scripts/Intermediate/comprehensions.py)
My exploration of list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions - concise ways to create collections in Python.

#### [Collections Module](scripts/Intermediate/collections_module.py)
My exploration of useful data structures from Python's collections module, such as Counter, defaultdict, deque, and namedtuple.

#### [Context Managers](scripts/Intermediate/context_managers.py)
My exploration of context managers (with statements) to properly manage resources like files, ensuring they are opened and closed correctly.

#### [Dataclasses Module](scripts/Intermediate/dataclasses_module.py)
My exploration of the dataclasses module, which provides a convenient way to create classes that are primarily used to store data.

#### [Decorators](scripts/Intermediate/decorators.py)
My exploration of function decorators, which are a powerful way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions without changing their code.

#### [Generators](scripts/Intermediate/generators.py)
My exploration of generators and the yield keyword, which allow creating memory-efficient iterators that generate values on demand.

#### [Inheritance](scripts/Intermediate/inheritance.py)
My exploration of object-oriented inheritance, showing how classes can inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.

#### [itertools Module](scripts/Intermediate/itertools_module.py)
My exploration of the itertools module, which provides efficient tools for working with iterators and creating complex iteration patterns.

#### [Lambda and Functional](scripts/Intermediate/lambda_and_functional.py)
My exploration of lambda functions and functional programming concepts like map, filter, and reduce.

#### [Magic Methods](scripts/Intermediate/magic_methods.py)
My exploration of Python's magic methods (also called dunder methods), which allow defining how objects behave with operators and built-in functions.

#### [Property Decorators](scripts/Intermediate/property_decorators.py)
My exploration of using the @property decorator to create getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes.

#### [Regular Expressions](scripts/Intermediate/regular_expressions.py)
My exploration of regular expressions (regex), which are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing.

### Advanced

These scripts document my exploration of advanced Python concepts.

#### [Asyncio Concurrency](scripts/Advanced/asyncio_concurrency.py)
My exploration of asynchronous programming with asyncio, showing how to write concurrent code that can handle multiple tasks efficiently without using threads.

#### [Descriptors](scripts/Advanced/descriptors.py)
My exploration of Python descriptors, which are a powerful mechanism for managing attribute access in classes, used to implement properties, methods, and more.

#### [Metaclasses](scripts/Advanced/metaclasses.py)
My exploration of metaclasses, which are "classes of classes" that control how classes are created. This is one of Python's most advanced features.

#### [Typing Advanced](scripts/Advanced/typing_advanced.py)
My exploration of advanced type hints and the typing module, showing how to add type information to code for better documentation and error checking.

## My Learning Path

This section reflects the order in which I explored these topics during my learning journey.

## Running the Scripts

I run these scripts using Python from the command line:

```bash
python scripts/Basics/hello_world.py
```

Or by navigating to the script directory and running it directly:

```bash
cd scripts/Basics
python hello_world.py
```

1. **Basics**: I started with fundamental concepts in this order:
   - hello_world.py
   - math_operators.py
   - string_operators.py
   - conditionals.py
   - lists_and_loops.py
   - dictionary.py
   - functions.py
   - simple_class.py
   - exceptions.py
   - working_with_files.py

2. **Intermediate**: After getting comfortable with the basics, I explored intermediate topics:
   - Started with comprehensions.py and args_kwargs.py
   - Then moved to decorators.py and generators.py
   - Explored the rest based on my interests and needs

3. **Advanced**: Once comfortable with intermediate concepts, I tackled advanced topics:
   - Started with typing_advanced.py
   - Then explored asyncio_concurrency.py
   - Finally, tackled descriptors.py and metaclasses.py
